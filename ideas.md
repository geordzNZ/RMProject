# App Ideas

## 1) Cricket Score Keeper
* **Background** Growing up, and until pre-covid, I have played a lot of cricket and at various stages I have umpired and recorded the scores for games, so know the game quite well. For a while now, I've been thinking about creating an app that could be used on a laptop, or possibly web page / tablet app. This could replace the big notepad/book that is normally used and also allow data to be put into a DB for later stats retrieval. It might also allow 1 person to do both scoring and upiring at the same time.
* **MVP** Lets you track a criclet game over by over / team by team etc / start with T10 ... 
* Extend to other game styles / Tournament draw creater

## 2) Viewing Database
* **Background** With covid, there was a lot more time to watch TV etc and also with the abundance of different streaming services and their associated series / movies etc. I found that it would be good to have some sort of record or what I've watched and/or things I want to watch. Be it movies / TV programs (seasons / episodes etc). It would be handy to have some thing available to track this stuff in... From the tool, I could then use it to look up new things that have piqued my interest, or is of a similar genre.  Kind of like a watch list that spans multiple services, to keep track. Could also store ratings/reviews/recommendations to share with others.
* **MVP** Store details of TV shows I'm watching, or want to watch.  
* Details like name / genre / where it is / season / episodes / watched / recommend / rewatch

## 3) Front of house delivery manager program
* **Background** I live in an apartment block, that has multiple buildings in the complex. There is 1 security / concierge desk that signs for courier deliveries, writes the details down and then physically puts those pieces of paper in our mailbox.  Over covid, I thought there would be a better way to do it, with some sort of a webpage or app.  The app would let the Concierge note the details, and then send notifications (email/sms/??) or the users logs in to check if they have deliveries. Then as an extension, it could be used as a group notice board for tennants to be advised of events/building maintenace / etc) or for tennents to contact building management. Then further extended into other parts of building management (like what I'm note sure yet)
* **MVP** App to store incoming delivery details, track pickup/storage locations etc and then manage comms to tennants
* Add group comms

## 4) Personal Exercise tracker
* **Background** I'm not big into exercise, but I should be!! and I think if I took the time to design/build something like this that would track excercies info (durations / reps / weights etc) then I would need to use it, so creating the tool, would motivate me to exercise more and use it, which would then lead to more developments on it (maybe). it would be also good to keep stats on the stuff I do, so I can track progress, to use that as inspiration too...
* **MVP** List exercises / dates / plans / stats

## 5) Places I've visited
* **Background** I used to travel a lot (not so much recently) but in this tool, I wanted some place where I could list off where I've been and the other details. This would 1) allow me to have a place to view trip info and images etc 2) would be a good way to share info with the friends and family back home in NZ. Could also add in a blog site of some sort.
* **MVP** List of Countries / Cities / Attractions and their details (dates / travellers / lat / long / etc) / list of places
* Display with pins on a map / add a blog to describe the events / some sort of image storage (once I'm rich and can work out storage/bandwidth)
* Search facility
